## Description

<div style="float: right;margin-left:20px;max-width:400px;">

**Starting Date:** {{ page.dat }}

**Organized by:** {{ page.organizator }}

The goal is to understand the key ideas behind gauge theories by using a toy version of a financial market. Such a market also has a gauge symmetry and is therefore ideally suited to discuss all important concepts like gauge connections, internal spaces, and curvature in an intuitve context.

No previous knowledge is required except for some basic high school math. The expedition will be a great preparation for more advanced expeditions that are dedicated solely to, for example, quantum field theory or general relativity.
